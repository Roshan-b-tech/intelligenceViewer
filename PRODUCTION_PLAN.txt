ðŸš€ One-Sheeter: Making the Intelligence Report Viewer Production-Grade in 7 Days

Day 1-2: Database & Authentication
- Replace mock data with a real database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- Use an ORM (e.g., Prisma for Node.js) for schema management and migrations.
- Integrate OAuth 2.0 or SAML for enterprise SSO.
- Store user roles and permissions in the database.
- Use Redis for session/token management and blacklisting.

Day 3: API Hardening & Security
- Use libraries like joi or zod to validate all incoming data.
- Add middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse.
- Lock down CORS to trusted domains.
- Set secure HTTP headers (e.g., with helmet).
- Log all sensitive actions and authentication events.

Day 4: Infrastructure & CI/CD
- Dockerize both frontend and backend.
- Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing, linting, and deployment.
- Use .env files and secret managers for config.

Day 5: Cloud Deployment & Scaling
- Deploy to AWS (ECS, RDS, S3) or GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Storage).
- Enable auto-scaling for backend services.
- Serve frontend via CDN (e.g., CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify).

Day 6: Monitoring & Observability
- Centralize logs (e.g., DataDog, ELK stack).
- Add Prometheus/Grafana or DataDog for API and system metrics.
- Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing (keep your UUID trace header!).
- Set up alerts for errors, latency, and downtime.

Day 7: QA, Pen Testing & Polish
- Write integration and end-to-end tests (Jest, Cypress).
- Test all user flows, edge cases, and error handling.
- Run security scans (OWASP ZAP, Snyk).
- Write clear API and user docs.
- Review accessibility, performance, and UX.
